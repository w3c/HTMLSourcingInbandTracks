        This specification is provided to promote interoperability among implementations and users of in-band text tracks sourced for [[HTML5]]/[[HTML]] from media resource containers. The specification provides guidelines for the creation of video, audio and text tracks and their attribute values as mapped from in-band tracks from media resource types typically supported by User Agents. It also explains how the UA should map in-band text track content into text track cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mappings are defined for [[MPEGDASH]], [[ISOBMFF]], [[MPEG2TS]], [[OGGSKELETON]] and [[WebM]].

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The specification maintains mappings from in-band audio, video and other data tracks of MIME-type/subtype media resources to HTML VideoTrack, AudioTrack, and TextTrack objects and their attribute values.
      </p>
      <p>
        A generic rule to follow is that a track as exposed in HTML only ever represents a single semantic concept. When mapping from a media resource, sometimes an in-band track does not relate 1-to-1 to a HTML text, audio or video track.
      </p>
      <p class="note">For example, a HTML TextTrack object is either a subtitle track or a caption track, never both. However, in-band text tracks may encapsulate caption and subtitle cues of the same language as a single in-band track. Since a caption track is essentially a subtitle track with additional cues of transcripts of audio-only information, such an encapsulation in a single in-band track can save space. In HTML, these tracks should be exposed as two TextTrack objects, since they represent different semantic concepts. The cues appear in their relevant tracks - subtitle cues would be present in both. This allows users to choose between the two tracks and activate the desired one in the same manner that they do when the two tracks are provided through two track elements.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A similar logic applies to in-band text tracks that have subtitle cues of different languages mixed together in one track. They, too, should be exposed in a track of their own language each.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A further example is when a UA decides to implement rendering for a caption track but without exposing the caption track through the TextTrack API. To the Web developer and the Web page user, such a video appears as though it has burnt-in captions. Therefore, the UA could expose two video tracks on the HTMLMediaElement - one with captions and a kind="captions" and one without captions with a kind="main". In this way, the user and the Web developer still get the choice of whether to see the video with or without captions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another generic rule to follow for in-band data tracks is that in order to map them to TextTrack objects, they need to be mapped to media-time aligned cues that relate to a non-zero interval of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every MIME-type/subtype of an existing media container format, this specification defines the following information:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Track order.</li>
        <li>How to identify the type of tracks.</li>
        <li>Setting track attributes 'id', 'kind', 'language' and 'label' for sourced text tracks.</li>
        <li>Setting track attributes 'id', 'kind', 'language' and 'label' for sourced audio and video tracks.</li>
        <li>Mapping text track content into text track cues.</li>

        <li><p>Track Order</p>

            The order of tracks specified in the MPD (Media Presentation Description) format [[MPEGDASH]] is maintained when sourcing multiple MPEG DASH tracks into HTML.

        <li><p>Determining the type of track</p>
          <p>
            A user agent recognises and supports data from a MPEG DASH media resource as being equivalent to a HTML track based on the AdaptationSet or ContentComponent mimeType:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>text track: the mimeType is of main type "application" or "text"</li>
            <li>video track: the mimeType is of main type "video"</li>
            <li>audio track: the mimeType is of main type "audio"</li>

            DASH text track data may be contained in files or encapsulated in MPEG media container formats ISOBMFF and MPEG-2 TS. DASH text track data contained in a file may be in the WebVTT or TTML format [[ISO14496-30]], 3GPP Timed Text format [[3GPP-TT]], or other format. Encapsulated DASH text track data may be in the format defined in this specification for <a href='#ISOBMFF-TT'>ISOBMFF text track</a> or <a href='#MPEG2TS-TT'>MPEG-2 TS text track</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            DASH text track data is in a file in the WebVTT format if the file MIME type is "text/vtt" and should be exposed as a VTTCue as defined in [[WEBVTT]]. DASH text track data is in a file in the TTML format if the file MIME type is "application/ttml+xml" and should be exposed as an as yet to be defined TTMLCue. Alternatively, browsers can also map the TTML features to WebVTTCue objects. Finally, browsers that cannot render TTML [[ttaf1-dfxp]] format data should expose them as DataCue objects [[HTML5]]. In this case, the TTML file must be parsed in its entirety and then converted into a sequence of TTML Intermediate Synchronic Documents (ISDs). Each ISD creates a DataCue object with attributes sourced as follows:

                MPEG-2 TS captions are in the CEA 708 format [[CEA708]]. Caption data is carried in the video stream in Picture User Data [[ATSC53-4]] for 'stream_type' 0x02 and in Supplemental Enhancement Information [[ATSC72-1]] for 'stream_type' 0x1B. Browsers that can render the CEA 708 format should expose them in as yet to be specified CEA708Cue objects. Alternatively, browsers can also map the CEA 708 features to WebVTTCue objects [[VTT708]]. Finally, browsers that cannot render CEA 708 captions should expose them as DataCue objects [[HTML5]]. In this case, each 'service block' in a digital TV closed caption (DTVCC) transport channel creates a DataCue object with TextTrackCue attributes sourced as follows:

                      CEA 708 captions do not have an explicit end time - a rendering device derives the end time for a caption based on subsequent caption data.

            ISOBMFF text tracks carry TTML data if the media handler type is "subt" and an 'XMLSubtileSampleEntry' format is used with a TTML-based 'name_space' field, as described in [[ISO14496-30]]. Browsers that can render text tracks in the TTML format should expose an as yet to be defined TTMLCue. Alternatively, browsers can also map the TTML features to WebVTTCue objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            TTML data may contain tunneled CEA708 captions [[SMPTE2052-11]]. Browsers that can render CEA708 data should expose it as defined for <a href='#CEA708Cue'>MPEG-2 TS CEA708 cues</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            3GPP timed text data is carried in ISOBMFF as described in [[3GPP-TT]]. Browsers that can render text tracks in the 3GPP Timed Text format should expose an as yet to be defined 3GPPCue. Alternatively, browsers can also map the 3GPP features to WebVTTCue objects.

            Tracks of kind "chapters" are found in the "Chapters" section of the WebM file Segment, which are all at the beginning of the WebM file, such that chapters can be used for navigation. The details of this mapping have not been specified yet and simply point to the more powerful Matroska chapter specification [[Matroska]]. Presumably, the 'id' attribute could be found in 'EditionUID', 'label' is empty, and 'language' can come from the first ChapterAtom's 'ChapLanguage' value.
          </p>
          <p class='note'>
            The Matroska container format, which is the basis for WebM, has specifications for other text tracks, in particular SRT, SSA/ASS, and VOBSUB. The described attribute mappings can be applied to these, too, except that the 'kind' field will always be "subtitles". The information of their 'CodecPrivate' field is exposed in the 'inBandMetadataTrackDispatchType' attribute.

            The only types of text tracks that WebM is defined for are in the WebVTT format [[WEBVTT-WEBM]]. Therefore, cues on a text track are created as VTTCue objects [[WEBVTT]]. Each 'Block' in the 'BlockGroup' of the WebM track that has the actual data of the text track creates a VTTCue object with its TextTrackCue attributes sourced as follows:
          </p>

          <p class='note'>Other Matroska container format's text tracks can also be mapped to TextTrackCue objects. These will be created as DataCue objects [[HTML5]] with 'id', 'startTime', 'endTime', and 'pauseOnExit' attributes filled identically to the VTTCue objects, and the 'data' attribute containing the Block's data.

            A user agent recognises and supports data from a Ogg resource as being equivalent to a HTML track based on the value of the 'role' field of the fisbone header in Ogg Skeleton:

          </ul>
          <p>
            If no Skeleton track is available, determine the type based on the codec used in the BOS pages, e.g. Vorbis is an "audio" track and "theora" is a video track.
